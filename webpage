<p>Before <b>milk based ice creams</b> were introduced in <i>10th century</i>, this summer treat was indeed made from ice. Industrial production of ice cream begun in 1851 in Boston, United States. Spreading of American made ice cream for military troops during World War II was a moment when entire world accepted ice cream as a perfect summer-time treat.</p>
<p>There are 70,000 <b>puppies and kittens</b> born in the <i>U.S. every day</i>, according to the Humane Society Animal League for Life. Considering there's only about 10,000 humans born in the U.S. per year, you can give each newborn baby at least one puppy as a birthday gift!</p>
<p>The <b>U.S. team's</b> first major victory came at the 1991 <i>World Championship</i> (retroactively named the 1991 Women's World Cup). The U.S. cruised to lopsided victories in the quarterfinals and semifinals, before defeating Norway 2â€“1 in the final. </p>
